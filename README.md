# ðŸ’¼ Machine Learning Engineer Salary Analysis & Prediction

This project applies data mining techniques on the "Machine Learning Engineer Salary in 2024" dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore, analyze, and predict salary tiers based on various features like experience, job title, company location, and more.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Clustering: KMeans, DBSCAN
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸš€ Features
- Clean and preprocess real-world salary dataset
- Perform EDA to uncover salary trends (2020â€“2024)
- Build classification models to predict salary tier (Low / Medium / High)
- Cluster employees using unsupervised methods
- Visualize insights with clear plots and charts
- Predict future average salary of engineers in IT field

## ðŸ“Š Highlights
- Used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters
- Created new engineered features like `salary_category`, `remote_type`
- Achieved model interpretability with feature importance analysis
